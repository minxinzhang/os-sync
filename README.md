# For you convenience:
There are two terminal output logs bundled. 
`barberfaster.log` for barbers working faster than customer arriving rate.
`barberslower.log` for the other way.
Each log has 15 test cases tuned with different combinations of number parameters. For more details, please check the report testing section.
